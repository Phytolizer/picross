# picross
My Picross project. Includes main menus and random puzzles of variable sizes; ALL puzzles are 100% solvable!

FEATURES:
- Random puzzles - Play a puzzle of any size, from 5x5 to 25x25.
- Puzzle creator - Create your own puzzles! These must be uniquely solvable.
- Keyboard controls! - Just in case you think mice are gross or something.
- Leaderboard - See how you stack up against other players. View it at https://westonreed.com/picross/leaderboard.php

TODO
- [ ] Online repository for puzzles
- [ ] Better looking graphics - better button highlighting, custom textures and animations
- [ ] More efficient system for generating puzzles, the current system is not optimal

<!--

I'm looking forward to where this project is going.
