# picross
My Picross project. Includes main menus and random puzzles of variable sizes; ALL puzzles are 100% solvable!

FEATURES:
- Random puzzles - Play a puzzle of any size, from 1x1 to 25x25.
- Puzzle creator - Create your own puzzles! These must be uniquely solvable.

COMING VERY SOON:
- Scoring system
- Other modes of control (i.e keyboard controls)

COMING NOT-SO-SOON:
- Better looking graphics - better button highlighting, images
- Save states? (may not happen since it is prone to cheating)
- More efficient system for generating puzzles, the current system is bad (it does work though)
