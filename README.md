# picross
My Picross project. Includes main menus and random puzzles of variable sizes; ALL puzzles are 100% solvable!

COMING SOON:
- Custom puzzles - these puzzles MUST be solvable! If they are not, the game will not allow it to be saved or loaded.
- Save states? (may not happen since it is prone to cheating)
- Scoring system

COMING NOT-SO-SOON:
- Online connectivity - share & rate puzzles with friends
- Online leaderboards
- Account system
- Better looking graphics - better button highlighting, images
- More efficient system for generating puzzles, the current system is guess & check (brute force) (bad)
